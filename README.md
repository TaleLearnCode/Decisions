## Intended Audience

This talk is designed to be accessible and beneficial for anyone involved in the software development lifecycle. It offers insights that can be applied regardless of prior experience with ADRs.

## Timeline

I will kick off the talk by spending the first minute with a relatable story about a project where the lack of documented decisions led to significant confusion and delays. This will set the stage for introducing Architecture Decision Records (ADs) to solve this common issue.

I'll then spend about two minutes defining ADRs and explaining their purpose in software development. I will go over the critical elements of an ADR: the context, the decision itself, and the consequences of that decision. To illustrate, I'll share a simple yet impactful example of an ADR, highlighting how it clarifies the decision-making process.

For the next two minutes, I'll present real-world examples demonstrating the benefits of ADRs. I will show how ADRs have improved team communication, facilitated the onboarding of new team members, and ensured a clear historical record of architectural decisions. These examples will underscore the significant positive impact that ADRs can have on project success.

I will then spend about three minutes walking through the process of creating an ADR. Using a prepared example, I will show how to draft an ADR, emphasizing the importance of capturing the context and rationale behind each decision. I will also introduce a template that simplifies the process of writing ADRs, making it accessible to everyone on the team.

In the penultimate minute, I'll share quick, actionable tips for writing effective ADRs, such as keeping them concise yet comprehensive and ensuring they are easily accessible to the entire team. I will also mention common pitfalls to avoid, like needing to be more specific or verbose, to help attendees create high-quality ADRs.
